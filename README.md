# Automated EC2 Instance Management with AWS Lambda and Boto3
This project automates the **starting** and **stopping** of EC2 instances using **AWS Lambda** and **Boto3**, based on instance tags.
---

## Project Overview
Using this setup, a Lambda function checks EC2 instances for specific tags:
- Instances tagged with `Action=Auto-Stop` will be **stopped** if they are running.
- Instances tagged with `Action=Auto-Start` will be **started** if they are stopped.

This is ideal for cost-saving or scheduled automation tasks.
---

## Technologies Used
- AWS EC2
- AWS Lambda
- AWS IAM
- Boto3 (AWS SDK for Python)
- Python 3.x
---

## Prerequisites
- AWS account with access to EC2, Lambda, and IAM
- IAM permissions to create/manage roles and Lambda functions
- Basic knowledge of Python
---

## Setup Instructions
### 1. Create EC2 Instances<br>
- Go to the **EC2 Dashboard**.<br>
- Launch **two t2.micro** instances (or free-tier eligible).<br>
- Tag the instances:<br>
  - Instance 1: `Key=Action`, `Value=tanuj-Auto-Stop`<br>
  - Instance 2: `Key=Action`, `Value=tanuj-Auto-Start`
---

### 2. Create an IAM Role for Lambda
1. Go to **IAM > Roles > Create Role**
2. Choose **Trusted Entity**: `Lambda`
3. Attach the following permissions:
   - âœ… Quick test: `AmazonEC2FullAccess`(Note: In a real-world scenario, you would want to limit permissions for better security.)
4. Name it something like lambda_ec2_manager_role.
---

### 3. Create the Lambda Function<br>
1. Go to AWS Lambda > Create function
2. Runtime: Python 3.x
3. Name: ManageEC2ByTag_tanuj
4. Assign the IAM role you created above.
5. Lambda Code
   You can use the below file for reference.<br>
   [lambda_function.py](https://github.com/tanujbhatia24/Instance_Management/blob/main/lambda_function.py)
---

### 4. Test the Function
1. Click Test in the Lambda console.
2. Use a simple empty test payload > {}.
3. Check EC2 Dashboard to confirm:
   1. Auto-Stop instance is stopped.
   2. Auto-Start instance is started.
